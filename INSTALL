nm2lp uses libpcap and the Wireshark wiretap libraries.  On Ubuntu systems, 
you'll need to install the libpcap-dev and libwiretap-dev packages, and the libgtk and libglib packages::

```
$ sudo apt-get install libwiretap-dev libpcap-dev libwsutil-dev libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev
```

After installing the library requirements, simply run "make" to build the
nm2lp executable.  Run "make install" to copy it to /usr/local/bin.
